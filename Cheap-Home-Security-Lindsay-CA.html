The first task is the alert of a siren, this enables everyone in your area including the property owners or company owner to understand that an intruder has been found.

Without it, you won't get the person-detection feature, personalized Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated areas within the camera's field of vision), or Sightline, a detailed, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera found activity. Being able to compare an automobile and a person, for instance, permits you to minimize unnecessary notifies.
