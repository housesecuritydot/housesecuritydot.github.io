<p>To determine reaction times for the monitoring company, we triggered each system a minimum of 5 times, using contact and motion sensing units. Nevertheless, remember that the monitoring company's response time has definitely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will respond to the alarm-- if they react at all. In Los Angeles, for example, all alarm calls should be confirmed, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone.

From there, Alexa will cycle your lights on and off to make it appear like you're home - and you'll also get a notification if your Echo speakers hear the noise of an alarm, or damaged glass.</p>
<p>The price of admission for the Deep Guard Home Security system isn't that high, even at $499, since it includes three outdoor cameras with two-way audio. And the $50-per-month subscription cost sounds costly, however it's not a lot when you consider that a live person is seeing a live feed whenever the cameras spot suspicious activity. That individual at Deep Sentinel's center can caution a suspicious person that they're being observed, and they can call your local police dispatcher if they refuse to leave or engage in a criminal act. It's not for everyone, but it's the best Do It Yourself outdoor security camera we have actually seen to date.</p>
