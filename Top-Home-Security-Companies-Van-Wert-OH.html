<h3>Fire Alarm System in Van Wert OH</h3>

Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers only an incorrect complacency considering that it prevents only "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to avoid a directed attack.</p>
