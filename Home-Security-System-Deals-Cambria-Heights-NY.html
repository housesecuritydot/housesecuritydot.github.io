<p>Installation - Who will set up the equipment? Companies like Abode, SimpliSafe, and Frontpoint sell equipment for DIY setup. You can get equipment in the mail, and established normally takes a few minutes to an hour. On the other hand, ADT and Vivint have professional installation; they send somebody to your home. In some cases there is an installation charge.</p>

I do not advise SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a sound maker.
