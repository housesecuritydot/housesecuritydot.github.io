<p>I have this camera hooked up to my desktop as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cable, I was able location the camera around 10 feet away from my desk intending into my hallway. The security program I use is "blue iris" which had the ability to discover the camera without trouble. The IR lights during the night have the ability to throw light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not almost as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, but it was half the price and it doesn't eat up my wifi bandwidth.</p>

We first saw Wyze since its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E Once we attempted it out, it quickly became a personnel (and friends and family) fave. I do not recommend SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a noise maker.
