<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face notifies, which can determine people the camera is identifying utilizing face acknowledgment. When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to identify those individuals and will send smart device signals with that info when they appear at your home. We believe this feature (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to want to identify anticipated visitors from random complete strangers. We also found the function to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this feature was always asking us to determine faces on a close-by TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also provide a wider series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
