<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don.

<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's simple to check in on the kids; two- and four-legged alike. We first observed Wyze since its super-cheap indoor security camera advised us of Disney's WALL-E Once we attempted it out, it quickly became a staff (and family and friends) fave. I do not suggest SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a sound maker. It can't send out informs, you can't manage it from another location, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>

Vivint offers a no-contract option where you can buy your equipment upfront or an agreement alternative where the cost of the equipment is topped the period of the agreement. Link Interactive has flexible contract and equipment options, reasonable prices, and very friendly customer support. It gives you a ton of various ways to safeguard your home, plus a bunch of wise home integrations so you can smartify your household's lives.</p>
