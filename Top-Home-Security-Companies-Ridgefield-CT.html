<p>One crucial exception: ADT has a landline monitoring strategy that's $36.99 per month, which could be an affordable option for consumers in backwoods. We advise cellular systems due to the fact that they're a lot more secure than landline systems, however there are some locations where cellular monitoring isn't available. If you live someplace without access to cellular monitoring, a landline system is still far better than no security at all.</p>
