<p>Monitored security systems are systems that are actively monitored by an expert home security company. When the system identifies a burglary, fire, or other emergency situation, it informs the security group and, sometimes, emergency responders. Regrettably, history has revealed that surveillance technologies put in location for one function undoubtedly broaden into other usages. And with video technology likely to continue advancing, the lack of any clear limits for what CCTV systems need to have the ability to do positions a substantial threat.</p>
<p>So why do not we rank ADT higher? In some methods, ADT annoys us. We see a lot of growing companies branching off and trying new things in the home security area. But ADT isn't keeping up. It costs a lot, its pricing isn't always transparent, and it still has long agreements. Not to point out that the customer care experience differs widely depending upon the dealership you opt for. </p>
