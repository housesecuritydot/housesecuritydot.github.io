<p>While you need to spend for cloud video storage on the Arlo Pro 3, it's one of the more economical subscriptions out there at $2.99 a month. This is an expensive security camera, however we think it deserves the financial investment. Increasing implementation of voice over IP technology (VoIP) is driving the adoption of broadband signaling for alarm reporting. Numerous sites needing alarm installations no longer have standard telephone lines (POTS), and alarm panels with traditional telephone dialer capability do not work reliably over some kinds of VoIP service.</p>

In other words, NVR records higher-quality video and allows for systems to be scaled up far more quickly than can be done with DVR.
