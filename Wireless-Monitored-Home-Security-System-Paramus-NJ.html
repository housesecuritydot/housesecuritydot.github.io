<p>With state-of-the-art burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't opt to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe subscription to have taping storage and advanced functions, such as alerts that distinguish between people and basic motion. We believe that's costly.</p>
