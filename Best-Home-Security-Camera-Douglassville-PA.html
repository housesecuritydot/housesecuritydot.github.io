<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally typical given that the doorway and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of recording video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as clients understand that the inexpensive customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's usually far too late given that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
