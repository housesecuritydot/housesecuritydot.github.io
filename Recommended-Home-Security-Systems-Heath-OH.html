<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as the majority of CCTV systems do nowadays - you will more than likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can move the large quantity of data needed by digital video and high resolutions at really fast speeds, and typically over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that generally powers analog security cameras; coax cables are reputable, but not suitable with IP cameras. Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the requirement for more electrical wiring. When the security cameras are not connected to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras may need less circuitry in the walls but will still require cables to power the security camera independently, typically via 110VAC power. </p>
