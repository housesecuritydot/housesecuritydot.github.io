We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe membership to have taping storage and advanced functions, such as notices that compare people and basic motion. We believe that's costly.</p>
