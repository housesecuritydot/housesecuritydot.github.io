<p>But monitored systems also tend to have a service agreement, which locks you into paying an often-pricey regular monthly charge for a set amount of time, normally one to five years. No-contract systems, which permit you to pay for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis rather than committing to a long-lasting arrangement, are becoming more typical. These systems in some cases cost more in advance for the hardware than professional systems that use a discount rate in exchange for that lengthy service arrangement.

<p>The Frontpoint Security system, along with its Interactive plan, was our preferred home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring plans, and features are almost similar to those of the Brinks system.
