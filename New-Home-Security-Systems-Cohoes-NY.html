<p>B. This chapter governs burglar alarm systems meant to summon authorities department personnel, requires registration, assessment of fees for excessive incorrect burglar alarms, offers treatments for repeat culprits, and offers a reliable date.

All smart-home devices are vulnerable to such events. Nevertheless, after this latest entry in a year-long series of questionable media reports, we have chosen to pull our suggestion of Ring's video doorbells. If you prepare to pair the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please first check out the What about Ring? area from our wise video doorbell guide. While we believe Ring's defects are a dealbreaker when it concerns video products, we don't believe that these concerns change the performance and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we remain confident in our present suggestion.</p>
