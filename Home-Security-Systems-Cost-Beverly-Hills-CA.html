<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it offers protection only when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" freely transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no unique equipment or software to identify it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies only a false complacency because it prevents just "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to avoid a directed attack.</p>
