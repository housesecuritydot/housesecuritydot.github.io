As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally regular because the entrance and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras.
