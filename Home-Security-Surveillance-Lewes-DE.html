<p>When deciding in between home security companies, who you select matters.

<p>Whether you decide to opt for a DIY system or go with a professionally set up system, you'll need to pay a annual or monthly cost if you require monitoring, and sometimes, you'll be struck with a monthly cost to settle the cost of hardware elements.

If you include monitoring, fees will differ: SimpliSafe charges $14.99 monthly for its no-contract monitoring service, while Nest charges $29 monthly. If you dedicate to a three-year agreement, the cost of the Nest service drops to $19 monthly. Ring's Protect Plus strategy opts for $10 monthly and does not require a contract.</p>
