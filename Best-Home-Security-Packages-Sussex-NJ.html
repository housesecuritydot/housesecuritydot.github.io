<p>Honeywell's DIY security system depends on a device called the Camera Base Station. It's an Amazon Echo-like gadget with a camera on top. It works as the brains of the system, getting in touch with sensing units and third party-devices via Z-Wave and managing them using the app or voice control. ADT offers monitored security packages that are tailored to secure your home.

When it identifies a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to identify those individuals and will send smart device alerts with that info when they show up at your home. We think this feature (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to differentiate anticipated visitors from random complete strangers. We also found the feature to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this feature was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a close-by TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also provide a broader series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
