When possible, we checked each camera using an iOS gadget (an iPhone 7 and an iPad) in addition to an Android mobile phone (utilizing a Nokia 3.1 running Android 9 Pie). Although FrontPoint uses a variety of equipment and home automation products at a sensible price, the one area where the company particularly stands out remains in Do It Yourself installation. </p>
