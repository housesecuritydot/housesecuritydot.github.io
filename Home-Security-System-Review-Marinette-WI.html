Logitech makes it easy to browse through events by clicking a series of bubbles.</p>

<p>What really sets this model apart is Nest Aware, a membership service that can be expensive but is vital. In truth, we don't advise buying this camera at all unless you prepare to include the membership. Without it, you will not get the person-detection function, customizable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated locations within the camera's field of vision), or Sightline, a comprehensive, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera spotted activity. Being able to distinguish between a person and a vehicle, for example, permits you to cut down on unneeded signals. And Activity Zones are a nice perk, especially if you're wanting to monitor a specific corner of the yard, an entrance, and even trash bin. </p>
