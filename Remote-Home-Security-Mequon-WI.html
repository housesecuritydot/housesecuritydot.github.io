<p>In modern times, security is of utmost value and it is only necessary to have safety measures in place. Designating security guards is a standard practice, but with developing innovation, a variety of surveillance aids are provided.

<p>It works with a wire or without, with a Canary Smart base station or without, and can run inside your home or inside - you get a lot of flexibility from this little device.

That's simply $0.66 a day (or about $20 a month) for standard home security equipment and the peace of mind of professional monitoring.</p>

Or what if you've finally gone on a much-needed holiday and your spotty cell service suggests you do not get alerted until the next day? If your system equipment includes an audible alarm, the sound may scare off prospective burglars-- if you're lucky. However the police won't come till you personally call them. </p>
