Reliability has actually long been at the heart of the dispute over wireless versus hardwired home security systems. It's an argument that's typically manipulated by aspects such as uncertainty over the vulnerability of wireless systems, consisting of disturbance from radio signals and glitches that trigger incorrect alarms. While enhancements over the last few years have made the technology more robust and popular (some systems today have their own unique wireless technology, which can't be disrupted by other signals), concerns persist over vulnerabilities that don't affect hardwired systems.</p>
