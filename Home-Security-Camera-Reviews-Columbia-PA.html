<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don.

We concur with you about Blink's remarkable battery life over on our outdoor security camera review, however its recording capability is a bit limited to recommend as a top pick.</p>
<p>There's a main 100db siren here too (silenced by the top button) which could be useful if your cameras are all installed outside - and doing so isn't a problem, with each bring an IP65 score that indicates they'll hold up against a jet from a pipe.

That's just $0.66 a day (or about $20 a month) for standard home security equipment and the peace of mind of expert monitoring.</p>
