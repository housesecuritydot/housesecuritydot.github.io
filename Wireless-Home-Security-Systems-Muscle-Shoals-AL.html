<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the extreme environment.</p>
<p>So why do not we rank ADT greater? In some ways, ADT irritates us. We see numerous growing companies branching off and trying new things in the home security space. However ADT isn't keeping up. It costs a lot, its prices isn't constantly transparent, and it still has long agreements. Not to discuss that the customer support experience varies widely depending on the dealership you choose. </p>
