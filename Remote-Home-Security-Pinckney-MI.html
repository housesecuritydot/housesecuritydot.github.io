<h3>Home Security Surveillance in Michigan</h3>

<p>Are privately owned, operated surveillance cameras to be dealt with the very same way as public cameras? We also require to draw great lines about 'Who really is watching you'? 'Who owns that camera anyway'? Huge brother? The Corporates? Or bugging neighbour? Who fixes a limit between public interest and harassment? At the minute, nobody! The camera might legally do what a peeping tom could not do. They could peer inside of windows with the full protection of the law on their side. If an individual was standing viewing outside a window it could be a criminal activity, yet the same individual could put a surveillance camera then remotely see a person within the privacy of their home. Most importantly, it is not against the penal code.</p>
<p>Fixed-mount security cameras are non-discriminating in what they record; whatever within their focus capability is recorded.
