<p>We don't recommend the SmartThings SmartCam because it's more complex than it needs to be. Recordings, notifies, and integration all require different IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are kept for as much as 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly fee (or $80 per year) to keep 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limitations, we often discovered action missing, thanks to inconsistent and prolonged gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
<p>Camera compatibility: Not every video recorder can deal with every camera. Obviously, DVRs need analog cameras, while NVRs utilize IP cameras, however the compatibility concern extends well beyond that distinction. Some NVR systems, for instance, are compatible with the IP cameras only from particular producers and not others. When buying a video recorder, you need to first make certain that the device will deal with the cameras you have actually purchased. If you're working with a surveillance system integrator to configure your system, the cameras should be able to offer you with the required info.</p>
