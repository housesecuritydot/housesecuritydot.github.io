<p>We installed our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside your home so we could point them at the very same area and expose them all to the exact same lighting conditions and New England weather. The exceptions were cameras that were integrated into outdoor lighting components, which I had actually set up on the porch by a licensed electrical expert (who takes place to be my spouse). All of the cameras were connected to the same 2.4 GHz network through a Wi-Fi router indoors (approximately 40 feet from the cameras); service to the house was Verizon Fios.</p>
