With an expertly monitored system, the house owner will be called by the monitoring company each time the alarm goes off, unless the house owner disables it rapidly. False alarms take place.

Surveillance cameras are also made in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no.
