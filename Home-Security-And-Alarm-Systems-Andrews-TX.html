<p>I discussed that all we would need to do is use any among the emergency situation call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which also included two-way audio, and that camera would end up being the interface into the VMS system. When a client pushes the emergency situation button, it sends double informs: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the main patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Furthermore, if the central patient-monitoring command center received a motion detection alarm, indicating that a high-risk patient left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would assess the risk and, if needed, might simply press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific flooring.</p>
