In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, removing the requirement for more circuitry. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras might require less electrical wiring in the walls but will still require cables to power the security camera separately, generally by means of 110VAC power. </p>
